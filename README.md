Hello! It's my first game created with JS. I've started coding it about 4 weeks ago, to learn that language. 
At the beginning it was a very simple project, in which I have had in mind to manage with CSS animations. But when I've started to code, new ideas for functionality came across.

In this game you have to select a cup. One of them has a ball inside. When you click it, you win the game. In every tour you have two chances to choose right cup. 
When you select right cup by first chance, you get points. But if you chose wrong cup twice, you lose them. Each difficuilty level has diffrent score value. When you acknowledge that diffiluilty level is too easy or too hard, you can change it after finish a tour.

Have a fun!
